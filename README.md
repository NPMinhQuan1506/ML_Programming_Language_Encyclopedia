# Language Core Lab

This repository is a **programming language encyclopedia**.

Its purpose is to document a programming language **from its conceptual foundations to expert-level internals**, covering not only *how* the language is used, but *why* it was designed, *how* it executes on real hardware, and *what trade-offs* it makes across different domains.

This is **not a tutorial**, **not a quick learning path**, and **not framework-oriented**.
It is a structured, long-term knowledge system intended to be read, referenced, and expanded over time.

## Scope and Philosophy

This repository treats a programming language as a **complete system**, including:

- Historical context and design philosophy  
- Syntax, semantics, and type system fundamentals  
- Major programming paradigms and their practical implications  
- Runtime architecture, memory management, concurrency, and performance  
- Compilation models, execution pipelines, and language internals  
- Real-world application domains and ecosystem tooling  
- System-level knowledge required to deploy and operate software at scale  

Each topic is explained with an emphasis on:
- **First principles** rather than surface syntax
- **Trade-offs and constraints** rather than dogma
- **Mental models** that remain valid across versions and frameworks

## Intended Audience

This repository is designed for:
- Engineers who want to **truly understand a language**, not just use it
- Developers building **large systems, libraries, or frameworks**
- Professionals transitioning toward **senior, architect, or systems roles**
- Anyone seeking a **reference-grade understanding** rather than short-term productivity

## How to Use This Repository

- Read it **non-linearly**, as a reference
- Revisit sections as your experience grows
- Treat it as a **living knowledge base**, not a finished product

> This repository aims to become a **personal encyclopedia of a programming language**, not a learning checklist.
